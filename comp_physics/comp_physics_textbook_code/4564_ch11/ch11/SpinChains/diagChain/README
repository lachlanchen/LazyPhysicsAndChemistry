NOTE: This directory contains two programs for the heisenberg chain.
The first program, 'heisen.f90' uses a Lanczos diagonalisation for
the Heisenberg chain. The second program, 'symheis.f90' exploits symmetries
in order to make the problem of the full diagonalisation feasible.
The first program comes in two flavours: the first is for the
gfortran compiler, and the second for the intel ifort compiler.
The difference between the two is that the first one does 
not use an external Lanczos routine as I did not get the call to
a matrix-vector multiplication routine to work. 
The gfortran should also work with ifort....

The symheis only works for ifort, as gfortran does not allow allocation
of an array of allocatable arrays. Sorry.....
